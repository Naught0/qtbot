comfortable pair of running shoes that you wear everywhere You like coffee and enjoy the Beatles You think the Robinson is the best looking projection hands down Winkel Tripel The Winkel Tripel projection is similar to the Robinson projection with less distortion at the poles However the distortion at equivalent latitudes differs as the longitude varies National Geographic adopted the Winkel Tripel in 1998 but you ve been a W T fan since long before Nat Geo showed up You re worried it s getting played out and are thinking of switching to the Kavrayskiy You once left a party in disgust when a guest showed up wearing shoes with toes Your favourite musical genre is post Hobo Dyer The Hobo Dyer projection is a cylindrical projection resulting in significant latitudinal distortion The result is a rectangular image with the poles vertically compressed and land near the equator stretched You want to avoid cultural imperialism but you ve heard bad things about Gall Peters You re conflict averse and buy organic l You use a recently invented set of gender neutral pronouns and think that what the world needs is a revolution in consciousness A globe It s a globe Yes you re very clever Pierce Quincuncial This is a square projection centred over the north pole The continents stretch out radially from the centre of the map and bits of Antarctica are visible in each corner of the projection You think that when we look at a map what we really see is ourselves After you first saw Inception you sat silent in the theater for six hours It freaks you out to realise that everyone around you has a skeleton inside them You have really looked at your hands The second column of projections starts here Van Der Grinten This projection displays the continents inside a perfectly

3D goggles which you use to view rotating models of better 3D goggles You type in Dvorak Goode Homolosine The Goode Homolosine projection attempts to minimise distortion by combining two equal area projections onto a split projection The map resembles a smooth unfolded net with landmasses kept whole where possible They say mapping the earth on a 2D surface is like flattening an orange peel which

season got toward the end The forecasters at the National Hurricane Center are the best of the best Their predictions are masterpieces of professional analysis But in November 2005 out in the center of the Atlantic far from any land the atmosphere stopped making sense And the forecasters who d expected the season to be long over by now started to get a little\u00c2 unhinged This is their story as seen through the actual 2005 NHC Advisories Two men one bald and one not sit looking at their respective computers at separate desks back to back The advisory is printed above them in caps small caps Courier type Tuesday November 29th 2005 Tropical Storm Epsilon The 26th named storm of the apparently never ending 2005 Atlantic hurricane season The same scene different text 10 PM Wed The window of opportunity for strengthening should close in 12 24 hr 4 PM Thu Slow but steady weakening is expected to begin in 12 24 hours The man with hair now has questions marks above his head 4 AM Fri Epsilon does not appear weaker 10 AM Fri Epsilon has been upgraded to a 65 kt hurricane The two still sit back to back 4 PM Sat Epsilon has continued to strengthen against all odds but can not maintain the current intensity much longer since the environment is becoming increasingly unfavorable Ditto 10 PM Sat Epsilon might or might not still be a hurricane but in any case it likely will not be one on Sunday 4 AM Sun Epsilon is downgraded to a tropical storm Yep 10 AM Sun Morning satellite images indicate that Epsilon has restrengthened A closer view of just the balding man at his desk There are no clear reasons and I am not going to make one up to explain the recent strengthening of Epsilon and I am just describing the facts However I still have to make an intensity forecast and the best bet at this time is to predict weakening Epsilon will likely become a remnant low I heard that before about epsilon haven t you The two men still sit back to back but the man with hair is now turning his head toward the other man with his arm resting on the back of his chair The bald man is leaning forward in his seat toward his computer while typing 4 PM Mon The cloud pattern continues to be remarkably well organized for a hurricane at such high latitude in December The other man has turned back to his own screen 10 PM Mon We have said this before but Epsilon really does not appear as strong this evening as it did this afternoon Just the bald guy now 4 AM Tue I have run out of things to say The two of them again 10 PM Tue The end is in sight It really really is But in the meantime Epsilon continues to maintain hurricane status 4 AM Wed The end is in sight yes but not quiet yet I thought I was going to find a weakening system and instead I found that Epsilon is still a hurricane Ditto 10 AM Thu Convection has vanished and Epsilon is now a tight swirl of low clouds I hope this is the end of the long lasting 2005 hurricane season This panel is blank and just reads Nope Enter Tropical Storm Zeta The men are still at their desks The bald man is leaning back on his chair and staring at his screen the other man s hair is noticeably disheveled and he has started growing a five o clock shadow Friday December 30th 2005 An elongated area of low pressure which ahd its origins in an old frontal trough began developing organized convection overnight Advisories are initiated on the 27th tropical storm of 2005 Any new storms would be in the 2006 season The men are still at their desks the man with hair is even more bedraggled looking 4PM Fri Although the atmosphere seems to want to develop tropical storms ad nauseam the calendar will shortly put an end to the use of the Greek alphabet to name them But 2005 s wouldn t end until Zeta did The bald man is now wearing a party hat and there is confetti in the air 10 PM Sat Zeta appeared on the verge of losing all of its deep convection a few hours ago but since about 21z the convection has been on somewhat of an increase again A close view of the man with hair at his desk 10 PM Sun This is like Epsilon all over again Most of the conventional guidance suggested that zeta should have been dissipated by now well zeta is pretty much alive at this time I have no choice but to forecast weakening again and again Both of them at their desks 4 AM Mon By 24 36 hours a significant increase in westerly winds should act to shear away most of the associated convection and finally bring the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season to a merciful ending 4 PM Mon It is hard to conceive that a tropical cyclone will be able to survive for very long in such a hostile environment therefore I have not backed off on the forecast of weakening And again 10 PM Mon Zeta is stronger than yesterday 10 AM Wed As you can see I ran out of things to say And again 4 AM Thu Satellite intensity estimates have decreased Zeta is downgraded to a 30 kt tropical depression And again 10 AM Thu Shortly after the previous advisory had been issued regretfully the intensity increased to 35 kt and Zeta is a tropical storm once again And again 10 PM Thu Although it seems as if Zeta will never die the forecast continues to show weakening Both men are now leaning back in their chairs exhausted 4 PM Friday January 6 2006 Zeta no longer meets the criteria of a tropical cyclone which means that both it and the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season have ended This is the national hurricane center signing off for 2005 The bald man still sits at his desk the man with hair is no longer in his chair Again we see the bald man at his desk and the other guy

of cheap newspapers and superior means of locomotion the dreamy quiet old days are over for men now live think and work at express speed They have their Mercury or Post laid on their breakfast table in the early morning and if they are too hurried to snatch from it the news during that meal they carry it off to be sulkily read as they travel leaving them no time to talk with the friend who may

Modern 1886 Conversation is said to be a lost art good talk presupposes leisure both for preparation and enjoyment The age of leisure is dead and the art of conversation is dying Frank Leslie s Popular Monthly volume 29 1890 Intellectual laziness and the hurry of the age have produced a craving for literary nips The torpid brain has grown too weak for sustained thought There never was an age

seems almost possible that the modern world might be choked by its own riches and human faculty dwindle away amid the million inventions that ahve been introduced to render its exercise unnecessary The articles in the quarterlies extend to thirty or more pages but thirty pages is now too much So we witness a further condensing process and we have the fortnightly and the contemporary which reduce thirty pages to fifteen pages so that you may read a larger number of articles in a shorter time and in a shorter form As if this last condensing process were not enough the condensed articles of these periodicals are further condensed by the daily papers which will give you a summary of the summary of that which has been written about everything Those who are dipping into so many subjects and gathering information in a summary and superficial form lose the habit of settling down to great works Ephemeral literature is driving out the great classics of the present and the past hurried

in large cities is an obvious phenomenon the mania for stimulants diseases of the mind are almost as numerous as the diseases of the body this intellectual condition is characterized by a brain

bicycles and tricycles tram cars and motor cars but in my humble opinion good honest walking exercise for health beats all other kinds of locomotion into a cocked hat T Thatcher A plea for a long walk The Publishers Circular 1902 The art of conversation is almost a lost one People talk as they ride bicycles at a rush without pausing to consider their surroundings What has been generally understood
